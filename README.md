# ThinkBoard-AI
Great choice! Building a **ThinkBoard AI** project is an exciting way to blend cloud computing, full stack development, distributed systems, DevOps, and container technology with a truly human-centered idea.

## **Core Features**

### 1. **Real-Time Multi-user Canvas**
- Drag-and-drop cards, sticky notes, drawings, tasks.
- Live sync across users (WebSockets or AWS API Gateway + Lambda).
- Responsive React/Vue.js frontend.

### 2. **AI Idea Generator & Summarizer**
- Users can highlight clusters of notes and invoke AI to generate ideas, summaries, or action items (AWS Lambda/SageMaker NLP model).
- Contextual prompts: “Suggest next steps,” “Summarize discussion,” “Relate concepts.”

### 3. **Knowledge Linking & References**
- Link cards/notes as relationships (like mind map).
- Embedded documents: Markdown, images, file uploads (AWS S3/DynamoDB).

### 4. **Task and Goal Tracker**
- Assign tasks, set deadlines, auto-progress nudges via AI (Lambda events).

### 5. **Voice/Chat Integration**
- Text chat for commentary, voice notes stored in S3, AI transcription (AWS Transcribe).

### 6. **Project Templates and Smart Suggestions**
- Save/reuse board layouts—AI suggests relevant templates and groupings based on context.
- “Inspiration mode”: AI surfaces related articles/resources for board topics.

### 7. **User Authentication & Groups**
- AWS Cognito for single sign-on, user groups, board privacy controls.

### 8. **Backend Containerization & Scalability**
- Dockerized backend (Node.js/Python FastAPI); auto-scale via AWS ECS/Fargate.
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/CloudFormation).

### 9. **DevOps Automation**
- Continuous Integration/Delivery via GitHub Actions—zero-downtime deployments.


If you're ready, I can help outline a detailed development roadmap, suggest open-source starter kits, or mock up a sample architecture diagram. What would you like to plan first? The user experience, tech diagram, or project phases?
